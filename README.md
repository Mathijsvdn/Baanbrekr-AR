HOW TO IMPLEMENT TUTORIAL PANELS
1. Attach the UIPanelScript.cs to a panel
2. Assign the origin panel (the one you are putting the script on)
3. Assign the next panel (the one the current panel needs to progress to)
4. Assign the previous panel (if its the starting panel of a tutorial, assign the same panel as the origin here)
5. Assign the nextButton to the next step button on the panel
6. Assign the backButton to the back button on the panel
